        <p>Parliamentary Debate: India's Parliament is currently holding a special discussion on "Operation Sindoor," India's response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, 2025. The debate is scheduled for 16 hours in both houses. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is expected to open the debate, with Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar likely to participate.</p>
         <p>Some reports mention claims by US President Donald Trump about brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following the operation, though India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh refuted these claims.</p>
